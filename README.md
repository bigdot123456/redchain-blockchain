## redchain-blockchain based on Hyperledger fabric
  redchain-block chain retained the essential and security characteristics of block chain technology, combined with the complex needs of the social network, to form a social block chain system suitable for self-organization, distributed node,mutual trust social network and corresponding economic and social system. It combines individual people with goods, trade, money, organizations and societies through block chain systems.

  on the basis of the open source [fabric series](https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric), redevelope to understand the depth of the industry integration with tck which respectively support private chain, chain alliance, and public chain, realize chain security, digital and decentralization, as follows:

-   the transaction process is irreversible, the results can not be tampered with, the transaction process can be tracked.
   
- all process use private key signature, permissions as endorsement, represent user's really behavior, the transaction process can not be interfered, so it realize authorized behavior.

-  the transaction is decentralized,the participating nodes reach  consensus status in the distributed network via pbtf (Byzantine algorithm) to ensure the stability and performance of the transaction.
-  distributed ledger,transaction data which save to any data node and dynamically extended to new nodes.
- intelligent contracts which agreed on business logic can be easily expand.
## redevelop of the Hyperledger fabric  as follows:
<p>fabric-ca and fabric can't sovle  account, applications which isolated issues; </p>
<p>performance monitoring and intelligent routing of fabric nodes;</p>
<p>dynamic extension node and security issues </p>
